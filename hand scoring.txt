This file is provided as an explanation behind what's going on with some aspects of the default hand scoring
algorithm, such as the derivation of constants and why the values going into this derivation are what they are.
It is separated into a distinct file due to its length.

Multiplier derivations:
SF slot:        14 * 3 * 11 * 14 * 14 * 13 * 13 * 13 * 13 * 12 * 11 = 341385748704
4oaK slot:           3 * 11 * 14 * 14 * 13 * 13 * 13 * 13 * 12 * 11 =  24384696336
Flush/FH slot:           11 * 14 * 14 * 13 * 13 * 13 * 13 * 12 * 11 =   8128232112
Straight slot:                14 * 14 * 13 * 13 * 13 * 13 * 12 * 11 =    738930192
3oaK slot:                         14 * 13 * 13 * 13 * 13 * 12 * 11 =     52780728
1st pair slot:                          13 * 13 * 13 * 13 * 12 * 11 =      3770052
2nd pair slot:                               13 * 13 * 13 * 12 * 11 =       290004
1st kicker:                                       13 * 13 * 12 * 11 =        22308
2nd kicker:                                            13 * 12 * 11 =         1716
3rd kicker:                                                 12 * 11 =          132
4th kicker:                                                      11 =           11
5th kicker:                                           no multiplier =            1

The factors listed here arise from the format of converting a hand to a single unambiguous numerical
representation of that hand's worth, so it can be easily compared to other hands.

The following should help explain where these numbers come from. Note that the "stored as x-y" here refers to
the number range required to represent all versions of that combination.

ROYAL FLUSH is just a straight flush with the highest possible straight.
Straight flush can be stored as on/off, with the ranking determined by the Straight value.
four of a kind can be stored as 0-13 (Must add an option for no 4oaK being present)

the two below can be combined into a 0-2 value (none, flush, full house)
full house can be stored as on/off, with the ranking determined by the 3oaK and first pair values.
regular flush can be stored on/off, with the raw card values stored in the kicker slots.
	this is why the kickers need extra 'room' to store pairs/3oaKs

straights can be stored as 0-10 (max card of straight goes from 5 to A, plus no straight)
3 of a kind can be stored as 0-13 (Must add an option for no 3oaK being present)

first pair can be stored as 0-13 (Must add an option for no pair being present)
second pair can be stored as 0-12 (same as above, but two A pairs would be a 4 of a kind)

first kicker can be stored as 0-12
second kicker can be stored as 0-12 (i *thought* having a pair was OK in a flush.)
third kicker can be stored as 0-12 (i *thought* having 3 of a kind here was OK in a flush)
fourth kicker can be stored as 0-11 (a four of a kind would be used instead of a flush)
fifth kicker can be stored as 0-10 (4oaK and full house would both be used instead of a flush)
